* Don't give me any code that doesn't compile. Keep working until everything compiles and passes unit tests. Use cargo check (not cargo build) to check for compile errors
* Test-driven development
* Update the readme after every major edit
* Keep the rust and zig SDKs up to date
* Keep examples up to date
